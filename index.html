    <h1>My Passionate Hobby: Cooking</h1>
    <p>My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. <br>
    Cooking is my hobby and has been for several years. I was about five years old, when I started learning <br>
    how to cook.<br><br>

    There are so many reasons I love to cook, cooking is one of those things that just comes naturally for me,<br>
    and I think I inherited, because I can cook almost anything and nail it on the first try, <br>
    much like my mother. But the main reason I love to cook is because it keeps me stress free. <br>
    For example when I am cooking I have very little time to think, <br>
    because the cooking is challenging my mind and taking my mind off the stress of everyday life.<br><br></p>
